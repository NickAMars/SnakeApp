This application can be see at the following url:
https://slipperapp.herokuapp.com/snakes
I had use boostrap, nodejs, express and mongodb for this application.
This was just a step in the water of nodejs for me.
I have undertand all the features in which i use for this app but
i would like to cut out the css which i use and use a cache for my mongodb
server which would help scale my application to be faster and more efficient.
I am planing on mastering nodejs,  css3, mongodb , and angular. I would like to play around 
with Photoshop and adobe illustrator.
So that i can be a more capable developer.
prior objective is to create an application which i can sell to people for income.
